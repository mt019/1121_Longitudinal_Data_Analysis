\section{Introduction}


The paper\footcite{Su2016} presents a novel approach to identifying and estimating latent group structures in panel data, a crucial task for improving the accuracy and interpretiveness of models in economics, social sciences, and beyond. 
Latent structures\Footcite{2023c} refer to the unseen or hidden relationships and patterns within complex data sets that are not directly observable. Recognizing them is vital because it enables the creation of more accurate and insightful models by revealing the underlying mechanisms that influence observed variables. This understanding can lead to more effective data interpretation and more precise predictions, and improve decision-making.
Earlier studies typically handled heterogeneity in panel data by assuming complete slope homogeneity for specified parameters, modeling unobserved heterogeneity through individual-specific effects. This approach, while convenient, has often been questioned in empirical studies due to its inability to handle the 
% nuanced 
heterogeneity
%  observed
  in real-world data\footcite[2216]{Su2016}.

% Recognizing these latent structures is vital because it allows for a better understanding of heterogeneity across different units, leading to 

In this study, penalized techniques are introduced: Penalized Profile Likelihood (PPL) for linear and nonlinear models without endogenous regressors and Penalized GMM (PGMM) for linear models with endogeneity. 
The novel aspect of the methodology is the introduction of Classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso), a variant of the Lasso, which effectively shrinks individual coefficients to their group-specific values while simultaneously performing classification and estimation. This method stands out for its ability to consistently estimate and classify group membership in the presence of unknown group structures, achieving uniform consistency and, in some cases, an oracle property where the estimators are as effective as if the true group identities were known\footnote{The oracle property is a desirable feature of a variable selection method in high-dimensional statistical modeling. It means that the method can consistently select the correct subset of predictors and estimate the coefficients of the non-zero predictors as well as if the true model were known in advance. In other words, the method can perform as well as an oracle who knows the true model.\cite[See][]{Fan2001,Hardy2017}}.
% A key innovation is the Classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) technique, which is a variant of Lasso designed to shrink coefficients to unknown group-specific values and simultaneously classify units into latent groups. This technique offers a robust way to handle the challenges of latent structure identification, ensuring effective classification and consistent estimation even when the group structures are unknown.

% The paper also demonstrated simulations and empirical applications, showing good finite-sample performance in classification and estimation tasks. This indicates that the methods are effective when applied to real-world data. The paper contributes significantly to statistical and econometric methodologies by providing robust tools for uncovering latent structures in complex panel data settings.


\section{Methodological Overview}



In the panel structure models, parameters are defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]

    \item \( \alpha = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{K_0})\): These are group-specific parameters.     
    The number of groups \(K_0\) is usually unknown in practice.
     Specifically, \( \alpha_k \) represents the parameter vector for the \( k^{th} \) group. The group-specific parameters are what the individual-specific parameters \( \beta_i \) shrink towards in the penalized estimation process. The \( \alpha \) parameters define the commonalities within groups and differences across them.
    
    \item \( \beta = (\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_N) \): These are individual-specific parameters. Specifically, \( \beta_i \) represents the parameter vector for the \( i^{th} \) individual in the panel data. These parameters are assumed to follow a group pattern, indicated as:
    \[ 
    \beta^0_i = \alpha^0_k \quad \text{for} \quad i \in G^0_k 
    \]
    where \( G^0_k \) is the specific group to which individual \( i \) belongs, and \( k \) indexes the group\footnote{The superscript 0 is used to denote the true values}.

\end{enumerate}

% In the referenced study, the term \(\psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \mu_i)\) plays a crucial role in the modeling process. Specifically, \(\psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \mu_i)\) is defined as follows:
In this study, \(\psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \mu_i)\) represents the negative logarithm of the pseudo-true conditional density function.

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
    % \item 
    \item This function is defined for the variable \(y_{it}\) conditional on \(x_{it}\), the history of both \((y_{it}, x_{it})\), and the parameters \((\mu_i,\beta_i)\).
    \item \(\mu_i\) denotes scalar individual effects, which are specific to each individual in the study.
    \item \(\beta_i\) refers to a \(p \times 1\) vector of individual-specific parameters of interest.
    %  that are central to the study's focus.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Penalized Profile Likelihood (PPL) Method}


Following Hahn and Newey (2004) and Hahn and Kuersteiner (2011), the profile log-likelihood function is defined for a given individual $i$ and time $t$ as follows:
\[
Q_{1,NT}(\beta) = \frac{1}{NT} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \hat{\mu}_i(\beta_i))
\]

where $\hat{\mu}_i(\beta_i) = \arg\min_{\mu_i} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \mu_i)$. Here, $\psi(w_{it}; \beta_i, \mu_i)$ represents a specified function of the data $w_{it}$, individual parameters $\beta_i$, and $\mu_i$. It can differ in different cases, according to the model assumption.

The goal is to estimate $\beta$ and $\alpha$ by minimizing the following Penalized Profile Likelihood (PPL) criterion function:
\[
Q^{(K_0)}_{1，{NT} \lambda_1} (\beta, \alpha) =Q_{1,NT}(\beta) + \frac{\lambda_1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \prod_{k=1}^{K_0} \| \beta_i - \alpha_k \|
\]
where $\lambda_1 = \lambda_{1NT}$ is a tuning parameter. The minimization of this criterion function produces classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) estimates $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ of $\beta$ and $\alpha$, respectively.

Traditional Lasso methods incorporate an additive penalty term that shrinks coefficients toward zero to enforce sparsity and variable selection. 
The C-Lasso, however, includes both additive and multiplicative penalty components. This mixed form allows each individual parameter $\beta_i$ to be shrunk towards one of several possible group-specific parameters $\alpha_k$.

Unlike traditional Lasso, which is generally used for individual parameter shrinkage and selection, the C-Lasso is designed to identify and differentiate between multiple groups within the data. It does so by allowing each parameter to shrink toward multiple potential group-level parameters, effectively classifying the data points into different groups based on their characteristics. 


Under the assumptions in Section 2.3, the PPL C-Lasso estimators have the following asymptotic properties.

% \subsubsection*{Theorems and Corollaries}

\textbf{Theorem 2.1 (Consistency and Convergence Rates):}\\
\textit{Assumptions Required:}  Assumption A1, along with the condition \(\lambda_1 = o(1)\).\\
\textit{Property:} Pointwise and mean square convergence of individual parameter estimates \(\hat{\beta}_i\) and the consistency of group-specific parameters \(\hat{\alpha}_k\).

\textbf{Theorem 2.2 (Uniform Consistency for Classification):}\\
\textit{Assumptions Required:} Assumptions A1 and A2.\\
\textit{Property:} Uniform consistency in classification, ensuring individuals are classified into the correct groups with high probability as sample size increases.

\textbf{Corollary 2.3 (Consistency of Group Sizes):}\\
\textit{Assumptions Required:} Assumptions A1 and A2.\\
\textit{Property:} Consistency of the estimated number of individuals in each group, \(\hat{N}_k\), for the true number \(N_k\).

\textbf{Theorem 2.4 (Oracle Property):}\\
\textit{Assumptions Required:} Assumptions A1, A2, and A3.\\
\textit{Property:} Oracle property of the PPL estimator \(\hat{\alpha}_k\) and the asymptotic normality of the distribution of \(\sqrt{N_k T} (\hat{\alpha}_k - \alpha_{k}^0)\).

\textbf{Theorem 2.5 (Asymptotic Distribution of Post-Lasso Estimators):}\\
\textit{Assumptions Required:} Assumptions A1, A2, and A3.\\
\textit{Property:} Asymptotic distribution of Post-Lasso estimators\footnote{Post-Lasso estimators are a two-stage procedure used in regression to handle high-dimensional data. Initially, Lasso regression is employed to select a subset of relevant variables by shrinking some coefficients to zero. This reduces model complexity and mitigates overfitting. In the subsequent step, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is applied but only on the variables selected by Lasso. This approach aims to combine Lasso's variable selection capability with the unbiased estimation of OLS, offering a balance between model accuracy and interpretability, especially beneficial in settings with many predictors but relatively few significant ones. \cite*[See][]{Belloni2013}}
, indicating that they are asymptotically equivalent to the PPL estimators with similar distributional properties.


\subsection{Penalized GMM Estimation}


In Section 3, the authors concentrate on estimating the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ within the context of a linear panel structure model represented by equation (2.3). Specifically, they consider the first-differenced system:
\[\Delta y_{it} = {\beta_i^{0}}' \Delta x_{it} + \Delta\epsilon_{it}.\]
% Here, $y_{it}$ represents the dependent variable for individual $i$ at time period $t$, and $x_{it}$ is a covariate vector. The authors assume that the initial values $y_{i0}$ and $x_{i0}$ are observed.

% To estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the authors propose a method called "penalized Generalized Method of Moments" or PGMM. 


The goal is to minimize the PGMM criterion function:

\[ Q_{ 2NT, \lambda_2}^{(K_0)}(\beta, \alpha) = Q_{2,NT}(\beta) + \frac{\lambda_2}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \prod_{k=1}^{K_0}  \| \beta_i - \alpha_k \|\]

Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda_2 = \lambda_{2NT}$ is a tuning parameter.
    \item $Q_{2,NT}(\beta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} z_{it} (\Delta{y}_{it} - \beta_i' \Delta{x}_{it})\right]^T W_{i,NT} \left[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} z_{it} (\Delta{y}_{it} - \beta_i' \Delta{x}_{it})\right]$
    % \item $N$ represents the number of individuals.
    % \item $K_0$ is the number of groups.
    % \item $Q(\beta)$ is a function related to the GMM criterion.
    % \item $Q^2_{2NT}(\beta_i, \alpha_k)$ is a term dependent on individual-specific parameters $\beta_i$ and group-specific parameters $\alpha_k$.
    \item $W_{i,NT}$ is a symmetric matrix that becomes asymptotically nonsingular.
\end{itemize}

Minimizing this criterion function yields the PGMM estimates $\tilde{\alpha}$ and $\tilde{\beta}$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is defined as $\tilde{\alpha} \equiv (\tilde{\alpha}_1, \tilde{\alpha}_2, \ldots, \tilde{\alpha}_{K_0})$ and $\tilde{\beta}$ is defined as $\tilde{\beta} \equiv (\tilde{\beta}_1, \tilde{\beta}_2, \ldots, \tilde{\beta}_N)$.

The PGMM estimators exhibit specific asymptotic properties under certain assumptions. These properties also include consistency, where estimators converge to the true parameters, and asymptotic normality, indicating that the distribution of estimators approaches a normal distribution as the sample size grows. Classification consistency ensures that the probability of misclassifying individuals into incorrect groups diminishes. The post-Lasso estimators, a refinement of the initial estimates, also demonstrate improved convergence rates and asymptotic normality.

\section{Simulations and Empirical Applications}

In the simulations, the finite-sample performance of their proposed methods for panel structure models with unknown group membership is evaluated. The study considers three data generating processes (DGPs) that differ in the model specification, the number of groups, and the parameter values. It varies the sample size, the tuning parameters, and the number of candidate groups in the simulations. It finds that their methods achieve high accuracy, and are robust to different choices of tuning parameters\footnote{I don't understand the choice of tuning parameters.}.

Section 5.1 highlights C-Lasso's robustness in empirical analysis, applying it to savings rates and civil war incidence across countries. 
% Section 5.1 showcases C-Lasso in studying savings rates and civil war incidence across countries.
 In the savings rate study, it assesses macroeconomic indicators like inflation and GDP growth for 56 countries, revealing the importance of homogeneity in panel data analysis. The results, indicating significant variations especially in the impact of inflation and interest rates, underscore the method's ability to discern distinct economic patterns.

\section{Subsequent Developments and Related Works}

\subsection{Lu and Su 2017}



In Section 2.5 and 3.4, the 2016 study provides a method for determining the number of groups as part of its broader objective to identify and estimate latent structures. It introduces a selection method based on minimizing an information criterion (IC).
It also outlines specific assumptions required for the consistency and accuracy of this method and provides a theorem supporting the effectiveness of the information criterion in selecting the correct number of groups under the specified conditions​​.

In the following 2017 study\Footcite{Lu2017}, the authors specifically focus on the empirical determination of the number of groups in \textbf{linear} latent panel structures. While the study is built on the framework established in the 2016 study, it delves deeper into the specification testing aspect of the problem.
It proposes a specific testing procedure (a residual-based Lagrange multiplier-type test) for determining the number of groups. This approach involves setting up hypotheses about the number of groups and then testing these hypotheses empirically to ascertain the correct number. 
Researchers could also first use the LM-type test to determine the number of groups empirically and then apply the C-Lasso method for classification and parameter estimation within this determined group structure.
% The methodology is designed to avoid overlapping with the estimation issues covered in the 2016 study, focusing instead on the testing aspect, a critical step for effective model specification in empirical analyses​​.

%     % \item Analyze how these studies have extended or applied the original methodologies.
%     % \item Reflect on the influence of the original study on later research and developments in the field.
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Su and Ju 2018}



As remarked in the 2016 paper, this paper\footcite{Su2018} extends the C-Lasso approach to dynamic panel data models with interactive fixed effects (IFE), emphasizing the estimation of latent grouped patterns. It addresses the complexity introduced by cross-section dependence and the dynamic nature of the models.
The paper introduces penalized principal component (PPC) estimation to handle the challenges posed by interactive fixed effects in the panel data models. This methodology is a progression from the earlier C-Lasso, incorporating additional considerations for the dynamic aspects and cross-sectional dependencies of the data. It continues to emphasize uniform classification consistency and the oracle property of the estimators.
% Contributions: The 2018 paper advances the previous methodology by tackling more complex panel data structures, particularly dynamic models with interactive fixed effects. 
It offers simulations to demonstrate the finite-sample performance and applies the improved method to study housing prices in China, identifying latent groups based on price persistence patterns​​.




% Here are some key points from the paper:

% Objective: The paper proposes a method to identify latent grouped patterns in panel data models with interactive fixed effects, where the slope coefficients are homogeneous within a group and heterogeneous across groups, but the group membership is unknown.

% Method: The paper extends the penalized principal component estimation by adding a novel penalty term that shrinks the individual slope coefficients to unknown group-specific coefficients. The paper calls this method the classifier-Lasso or C-Lasso.
% Results: The paper shows that the C-Lasso can achieve simultaneous classification and estimation in a single step, and exhibits the desirable properties of uniform classification consistency and oracle property. The paper also proposes information criteria to select the number of factors and groups, and conducts simulations and an empirical application to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

% Contribution: The paper develops a new Lasso method that can handle panel data models with interactive fixed effects and parameter heterogeneity, and provides theoretical and numerical evidence for its validity and usefulness.

\subsection{Su et al. 2019}
The 2019 study\footcite{Su2019}, progressed by proposing a heterogeneous time-varying panel data model with latent group structures that allows coefficients to vary over both individuals and time. This model treated coefficients as smooth functions of time and proposed a penalized sieve estimation method based on the classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) for identifying individual membership and estimating group-specific functional coefficients. This improvement addressed the need for modeling individual heterogeneity and smooth structural changes over time, which are often observed in longitudinal or panel data sets. The 2019 study also extended the application range, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness in classifying and estimating in different contexts and providing more robust and flexible modeling for panel data with latent structures.

\subsection{Wang and Su 2021}

The 2021 study\footcite{Wang2021} proposes a procedure for identifying latent group structures in nonlinear panel data models. This includes a sequential binary segmentation algorithm (SBSA) for estimating group structures and a detailed examination of the model parameters' estimation and their asymptotic properties​​. It allows the presence of common parameters across all individuals, corresponding to the mixed
panel structure model mentioned in Section 2.7 of the 2016 study. 


% In summary, the 2019 study improved upon the 2016 study by introducing a model that accommodates time-varying coefficients and smooth structural changes, expanding the applicability and robustness of the penalized techniques for identifying latent structures in panel data. 
% 2019 Study: "Sieve Estimation of Time-Varying Panel Data Models":
